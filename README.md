# Intermediate Coding Evaluation

This task should take 2-3 hours for anyone familiar with XML parsing and a graphing library with an additional hour of research around NLTK (or non-Python equivilent module).

While completing this task will be much more straight forward using Python's NLTK module, you are welcome to complete this task in the programming language of your choice.

Write a program to parse the provided audio transcripts in this repository and produce the following:

* Print to stdout the an evaluation of the sentiment of the transcript rated as one of the following: positive, neutral, or negative.

* Output a graph as an image file.  This graph should be a breakdown of the complete transcript by parts of speech. (Example, how many nouns, how many verbs, 'other/unknown', etc..)

BONUS:

* Print some sort of confidence/fidelity score rating the believed accuracy of the transcript compared to the (unprovided) original audio.

Don't go overboard here as it not necessary, but might be fun!

You may state your assumptions and feel free to add additional justification as well. Please be prepared to discuss it when you come on site.

You script should be delivered in the form of a gist.
